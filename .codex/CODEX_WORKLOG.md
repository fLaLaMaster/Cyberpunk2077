# Codex Worklog

This is a chronological handoff log. Add new entries at the top of the History
section. Record material changes, decisions, validation, and generated outputs;
do not use it as a raw command transcript.

## Current state

- Scanner version: `0.1.0`
- Implemented ecosystem: ArchiveXL
- Primary report: `reports/current/compatibility-report.html`
- Automated tests: 9 passing
- Last complete scan: successful on 2026-08-02
- Frozen inputs were not modified

## History

### 2026-08-02 — Searchable HTML report

Implemented a self-contained offline HTML compatibility report.

Changes:

- Added `src/cp77compat/html_report.py`.
- Added free-text search across rule IDs, mods, paths, sectors, summaries, and
  explanations.
- Added severity, rule, and mod filters.
- Added pagination and selectable page size.
- Added expandable finding details and lazily rendered evidence JSON.
- Embedded report JSON safely without external JavaScript, CSS, CDNs, or a web
  server.
- Updated `reporting.py` so every scan creates
  `compatibility-report.html` automatically.
- Updated `README.md`.
- Added an HTML safety/embedding unit test.

Validation:

- Nine unit tests passed.
- Regenerated the full current report.
- Validated that the HTML embeds all 30 findings and all filter controls.
- Final HTML size was approximately 390 KB.

### 2026-08-02 — ArchiveXL scanner MVP

Created the initial Python scanner in an empty project directory.

Changes:

- Added Python package structure and `pyproject.toml`.
- Added read-only Vortex inventory and deployment attribution.
- Added exact relative-path collision reporting.
- Added WolvenKit 8.19.0 archive indexing via `archiveinfo --list`.
- Added parallel indexing and SHA-256 keyed manifest cache.
- Added ArchiveXL YAML/JSON parsing, including duplicate-key detection and
  lenient handling for installed files containing tab characters.
- Added localization, factory, streaming block, streaming sector, and streaming
  node deletion references.
- Added loose-file and indexed-archive resource resolution.
- Added streaming-sector overlap analysis.
- Consolidated repeated sector findings by participant set to avoid hundreds of
  nearly identical report entries.
- Added JSON and Markdown reports.
- Added `run-scanner.cmd` because PowerShell script execution was disabled.

Validation:

- Parsed all 104 installed `.xl` files without an unexplained parser failure.
- Indexed 78 relevant archives and 5,458 members with zero WolvenKit failures.
- Extracted 14,315 ArchiveXL semantic references.
- Confirmed Vortex attribution for the four known non-archive physical path
  collisions.
- Second cached full scan completed in approximately 33 seconds.
- Eight tests passed at the end of this milestone.

### 2026-08-02 — Initial compatibility assessment and design

Inspected the frozen game and Vortex staging layouts and established the scanner
approach.

Observed corpus:

- 266 mod directories and 3,476 files.
- 3,309 non-archive files, including 1,235 REDscript files, 250 CET Lua files,
  194 YAML files, 104 `.xl` files, and 18 DLL/ASI files.
- Four exact non-archive path collisions representing two known Vortex conflict
  groups.

Design decisions:

- Build a universal inventory/evidence model before ecosystem analyzers.
- Start ecosystem analysis with ArchiveXL, then reuse YAML infrastructure for
  TweakXL.
- Use `archiveinfo --list` without extraction for archive manifests.
- Add selective, scanner-owned extraction only when semantic payload inspection
  requires it.
- Keep findings confidence-aware and distinguish definite conflicts from review
  candidates.
